handposturerecognition
======================

Hand posture recognition project done in Python.

Concepts used :

Dimentionality extraction : PCA, LDA
Classification : kNN, Bayesian

Implementation : Python, NumPy, SciPy

----------- IMPORTANT ------------
I will not be publishing the data-set used for this project as it is somebody else's work.

DISCLAIMER
1. This source has been uploaded only for the purpose of reference.
2. The motive behind is to give some support to those who are doing Pattern Recognition projects which
   are primarily done in MATLAB, in Python.
3. The amount of support from profs in order to do projects in Python, as opposed to MATLAB is less.
4. Please do not use my code per-se for anything. Learn the implementation methods. My implementation might be 
   buggy/ inefficient.
